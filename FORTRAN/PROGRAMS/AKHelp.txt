Steps to compile and run fortran programs using given compiler-
1)Open DOS and go to the directory in DOS where the fortran compilers
  are copied.
2)In the DOS shell enter the command- FOR1 <filename> (Filename
  consists full path of the file if it is not present in the current
  directory).
3)Now write- PAS2 and press enter.
4)Lastly give the command- LINK <filename> to link the file (Here 
  filename consists just the name with or without .obj extension.)
5)Now the setup of the program would have been built in the current
  folder.Just write the name of program and press enter & enjoy
  FORTRAN.
